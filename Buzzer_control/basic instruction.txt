BUZZER ALERT ON OFF
Here in the button “ON” ,
analogWrite(0, 250) i.e. 0 is the pin number and 250 is the value.
So, you can give any value in between 0-255 in place of “250”.
And in the button “OFF”
analogWrite(0, 0) i.e. the pin number is 0 and the value also must be 0 so when you click on the “OFF” button there should not be any sound from the Buzzer.
